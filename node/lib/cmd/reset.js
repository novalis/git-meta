command should not be confused with the 'revert' command.  The 'reset'
command can be used to return a tree to a previous state in history; the
'revert' command, on the other hand, creates new commits that undo previous
changes.  After resetting the HEAD of the meta-repository, this command will
apply the same change to all open sub-repositories, changing their HEADs to
the commit indicated by the (new) HEAD in the meta-repository.  The index
and working directory of meta- and sub-repositories may or may not be affected
depending on which mode (soft, mixed, or hard) is used; see the documentation
for each mode for more information.
