/*
Argparse literally can't represent git's semantics here.  Checkout
takes optional arguments [branch] and [files].  In git, anything after
"--" (hereinafter, "the separator") is part of "files".  So if you say
"git checkout -- myfile", it'll assume that last argument is a file.

There are two types of arguments that argparse recognizes: regular and
positional.  Branch can't be a non-required regular argument, because
regular arguments must have names which start with "-".  So it must be
a positional argument with nargs='?'.  In argparse, the right side of
"--" is always positional arguments.  And that means that the branch
will be read from the right side of the separator if it is not present
on the left side.

(Incidentally, the same is true of Python's argparse, of which node's
argparse is a port.)

Thanks, git, for using "--" for an utterly non-standard fashion.
