/**
 * For each open submodule that exists in the commit indicated by the specified
 * `source`, push a synthetic-meta-ref for the `source` commit.
 * If all sub-repo pushes succeed, push `source` to
 * to the specified `target` branch in `remoteName`.  If any pushes fail, throw
 * a `UserError` object.
 *
 * Note that this strategy is naive: it does not handle the following
 * situations:
 *
 * - closed submodules with commits that need to be pushed
 * - submodules that do not exist in the `source` commit, but did previously
 *   and need synthetic-meta-refs
 * - submodules with divergent histories, i.e., the commit we create the
 *   synthetic-meta-ref for doesn't contain one or more commits that need to be
 *   pushed in its history
 *
 * Addressing these situations would have a performance impact, requiring
 * calculation and traversal of all meta-repo commits being pushed.  We should
 * probably add a way to do an "exhaustive" push.
